Run this script to perform the same commands across multiple machines

This contains a script file I use on a daily basis. Once you add your usernames and IP addresses to the relevant arrays, the script will SSH and perform commands on all the servers. I have multiple machines I need to perform regular tasks (like updating), this script saves me so much time. With SSH key authentication, you can make this very painless. I would recommend that you add a script on each server that you can run using this script.
